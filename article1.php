					<h2>Etymology</h2>
					England got its name in honor of the Angles, a Germanic tribe, along with the Saxons and Utes migrated to the island of Great Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. e. Some historians believe that the tribe was the descendants of those who lived on the Angeln Peninsula, part of the Jutland Peninsula, which is today part of northern Germany.
					The first mention of the Angles is in a work called "Germany", written in 98 AD. e. by the ancient Roman historian Tacitus.
					According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the earliest known mention of the name England dates back to the southern part of the island of Great Britain in 897.
					<h2>Geography</h2>
					England occupies two thirds of the island of Great Britain. In the north it borders with Scotland, in the west - with Wales.
					The landscape of England is mostly rolling hills, with more mountainous terrain to the north. Highlands and lowlands are conditionally divided along a line between the mouth of the Tees Teesside in the northeast and the mouth of the Aix Devon in the southwest. To the east is a low-lying marshland that has been largely drained for agricultural use.
					The six largest cities in England in descending order of population are London, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool and Manchester.
					<h2>History</h2>
					The territory of modern England at the time of the invasion of Julius Caesar in 55 BC e., like a century later, by the time of the capture of the emperor Claudius, inhabited by Celtic tribes called Britons. As a result of the capture of the entire southern part of the island, modern England and Wales became part of the Roman Empire until its collapse in the V century AD. e.Without the help of the Roman legions, Roman Britain could not for a long time resist the barbaric Germans who appeared in the 5th-6th centuries, as the chronicles testify, at the invitation of the Britons themselves, who, with their help, hoped to protect themselves from the Celtic tribes from the north - the Picts and Scots. The aliens were of three groups - Jutes, Saxons and Angles. Having mastered the territory of the Britons, these Germans began to push them into the territory of Wales and Cornwall. Over time, separate kingdoms were formed on the lands occupied by the Germanic newcomers, forming, in particular, the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy the union of the seven kingdoms.From time to time, one of the seven Anglo-Saxon kings, called Britwalda, which can be loosely translated as Ruler of Britain, took control of most of England - so it is difficult to name the moment when England was finally unified. According to some descriptions, the unification came along with the invasion of the Danish Vikings, who captured the eastern part of England. Egbert, King of Wessex, died in 839, is often called the first king of all England, although the title King of England did not appear until two generations later, during the reign of Alfred the Great, 871-899.William the Conqueror Some historians start counting rulers with the Norman conquest in 1066, the numbering of English monarchs also uses this event as a zero point, for example, Edward I, crowned in the 13th century, was not the first king with that name - but he was the first Edward since 1066 ... But William the Conqueror did not found or unite the country, but only captured the existing England, establishing Franco-Norman rule. At the end of the 13th century, the neighboring principality of Wales was finally conquered by England and became part of the English kingdom. The history of England as an independent state goes through.Middle Ages and Renaissance to the reign of Elizabeth I, the last queen of the Tudor dynasty, after which James I reigned, who was king of Scotland under the name of James VI. The monarchical union of England and Scotland, which took place in 1603, was supplemented a century later by the Act of Union of 1707, which, in accordance with the Treaty of Union concluded a little earlier, finally united England and Scotland into the Kingdom of Great Britain. Kingdom of Great Britain.
